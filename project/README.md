# Blinky Buzzy
To create this project you must use the command make, make install for timer,
and make load for the data to be created on the MSP430. The MSP430 will
display a serious of shapes on it's interface that will be changed with it's
switches and interrupt handlers. The music that will be
played when the first button to the left is pressed is "Twinkle twinkle litter
star", and contiuously move the shapes until switches are not initiated. When
the second switch is initiated it will soley just move the shapes, when the
first switch is pressed it will play twinkle, and when the third or fourth
switch is initiated it will restart the MSP430 so that these options may
render again.
