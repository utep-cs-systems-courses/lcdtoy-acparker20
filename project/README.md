#Project 2, Blinky Buzzy
To create this project you must use the command make, make install for timer,
and make load for the data to be created on the MSP430. The MSP430 will blink
when make load is complete, in an alternating fashion. The music that will be
played when the first button to the left is pressed is "Twinkle twinkle litter
star", this was made possible by reading the notes that were taken from
Noobnotes.com and creating an array of lettered notes. After the music
commences and finishes, the LEDs will once blink in an alternating fashion
again.
